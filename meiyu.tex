\begin{abstract}
A growing body of literature claims a change in summer rainfall distribution over China after the late 1970s (the ``South Flood North Drought''). In these months, rainfall characteristically occurs along zonal bands with a meridional tilt (the Meiyu Front). We construct a novel database that tracks all occurrences of frontal rainfall over China on each day from 1951 to 2007 from APHRODITE rain gauge data, and reports their latitude, strength, tilt and width. An unprecedented Meiyu climatology is obtained. In addition, the latitude of frontal events is known to correspond to the position of the tropospheric jet. Therefore, we search for correspondence between front and jet position, and coupled changes in behavior with time. Two robust changes are observed in front behavior between the time periods 1951-1979 and 1980-2007: 1) A significant decrease in the frequency of pre-Meiyu (May) frontal events after 1979 and 2) a southward shift in late season Meiyu events (mid-July to August) found both in the front and jet databases. Our results hold the promise of coupling regional climate change to \nth{21} century global change.

\section{Introduction}
 
 China receives about 60\% of its rainfall from May to August, known collectively as the East Asian summer monsoon. The period of peak rainfall within this monsoon features a northward-migrating front known as the Meiyu front (lit. ``Plum rains''  -- capitalize front?), and lasts roughly from early June to mid-July (``Meiyu Season''). A growing volume of evidence suggests a shift in mean rainfall patterns over China beginning in the late 1970s, with increased flooding in the south and droughts in the north (the ``South Flood North Drought''). A permanent change would have major humanitarian impacts on the densely-populated eastern Chinese plain, where a sizable fraction of the population depends on agriculture. The Chinese government has already embarked on a costly engineering project to reroute water from the Yangtze to the Yellow River, the South-North Water Transfer Project.
 
	The complex atmospheric dynamics of the East Asian summer monsoon remain a source of debate \citep{Sampe2010,Chen2014}. The behavior of the Meiyu front has been discussed in the seasonal mean\citep{Ding2005}, and in relation to interannual rainfall variability \citep{Kosaka2011}. However, to our knowledge, no comprehensive statistics of daily Meiyu behavior exist. We have developed an algorithm to compile a 57-year climatology (1951-2007) of frontal events in China (hereafter referred to as Meiyu events) based on the APHRODITE rain gauge product. In addition, we test the covariance of daily Meiyu behavior with that of the tropospheric jet, using an existing database from \citet{Schiemann2009}. Past work has compared jet and Meiyu variability over shorter time periods or with coarse resolution\cite{Liang1998}, but none has systematically compared the two.  Finally, given our daily Meiyu climatology, we determine whether there are apparent changes in behavior over the 57 years, and whether these also correspond to changes in jet behavior.


%Current theory suggests that the tropospheric jet plays a major role in Meiyu formation, either by zonal advection of sensible heat from the Tibetan Plateau upwind \citep{Sampe2010}, or as part of the orographically forced circulation that produces meridional wind convergence over China\citep{Chen2014}.

% Paper may be short enough that it is unnecessary to delineate what each section contains.
%	In the following text we seek to achieve the following objectives: 1) Define an objective climatology of the Meiyu front; 2) Show the positions of the tropospheric jet associated with different configurations of the tropospheric jet; 3) Show that the Meiyu front and tropospheric jet covary on a daily scale; and 4) Suggest a dynamic lens to understand the observed climatology of Meiyu front and jet.
	
\section{Data sets}

	The analysis contained in this paper relies on two data sets, APHRODITE and Schiemann et al's database of jet counts. APHRODITE (Asian Precipitation - Highly-Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation of the Water Resources) \citep{Yatagai2012}. The APHRO\_MA\_V1101 product includes 57 years (1951-2007) of daily precipitation (PRECIP product, units mm day$^{-1}$) and station coverage (RSTN product) on a .25\textdegree\ $\times$ .25\textdegree\ grid (roughly 25 km spacing) between 60\textdegree E-150\textdegree E and 15\textdegree S-55\textdegree N. We focus on the subregion from 100E-123E and 20N-40N as the area of occurrence of Meiyu events. Rain gauge products present an analytical challenge because the distribution of stations is uneven in space and changes with time. Station density over eastern China improves beginning in the 1970s from X to Y (INSERT ACTUAL NUMBERS). However, the spacing of stations generally does not exceed 100 km, which should be more than sufficient to resolve the macroscopic scale of a frontal event.

	For tropospheric jet variability, we employ a database based on ERA-40 reanalysis data developed by \citet{Schiemann2009}. Their database includes every appearance of a tropospheric jet in East Asia for 1958-2001 at 6-hourly intervals using simple criteria: Positive zonal wind and local maximum in excess of 30 m/s. We have modified Schiemann et al.'s algorithm in several respects: ...
	
\section{Meiyu Climatology}
\subsection{Algorithm}

%I am debating the best way of showing the algorithm - other options: Simply write it out in one dreary paragraph, or use a diagram. If diagram, have to be careful since each figure counts as 500 words.

\textbf{List version}

For each day from 1 January 1951 to 31 December 2007 (20,819 total), the algorithm determines whether a frontal event is present or not inside the window of 105-123E and 20-40N, and if it exists returns its properties. In addition, it is observed that some days feature two frontal events. If a primary event is detected, the algorithm therefore checks for a secondary fit as well. The algorithm follows the subsequent checklist:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The maximum daily rainfall for each longitude is found. If there exists a 5\textdegree continuous chain of maxima (20 points in a row) exceeding 10 mm/day, we proceed to step 2 and attempt a fit. Otherwise, the day is thrown out.
	
	\item A weighted least-squares linear fit of the \textit{latitudes} of the maxima is attempted, using the intensity of the maxima as weight.
	
	\item A recursive algorithm converges on a best estimate. In each iteration, we find a new set of maxima within \textit{k} degrees of the previous best fit line, and again repeat the weighted linear fit in step 2. $k$ is progressively decreased with each iteration.
	
	\item Using our final best estimate from step 3, we define the ``quality score'' $Q$ as the fraction of total daily precipitation that falls within 5 degrees of this fit line.
	
	\item As mentioned, we check for a secondary front. We remove all precipitation within the primary front and again apply the front criterion in step 1 to the leftover rainfall map. If passed, steps 2-4 are repeated to find a best estimate for a secondary front.
	
	\item If a secondary front is found, two additional quality scores $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are determined. $Q_1$ is defined as the fraction of rainfall contained in the primary front \textit{after removing all rainfall associated with the secondary front}. Likewise $Q_2$ is the Q score of the second front after removing all rainfall from the primary front.
			
\end{enumerate} 
	
In some cases, a fit will be achieved, but its quality will be too poor to include in our statistics. To check for this scenario, we use the quality scores $Q$, $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, and the ``Taiwan fraction'' (TW), defined as the percentage of daily rainfall that falls on the island of Taiwan. If $TW > 20\%$, the day is thrown out. Such days are dominated by a local storm reaching Taiwan and rarely exhibit a strong front. Subsequently there are two ways a day may be included: 
	
\begin{enumerate}
	\item if $Q>.6$, the day is included in our statistics. If $Q_2$ also is greater than .6, the day will be classified as a double front day.
		
	\item If $Q<.6$, a day can only be included if both $Q_1 \mathrm{\textbf{ and }} Q_2 > .6$. In such cases, the quality of fit is initially obscured by the presence of multiple fronts. We classify the day as a double front day.
\end{enumerate}	
		
	In practice, days with secondary fronts constitute a small fraction of all days ($>$ 5\%) but are more common during certain seasons.
		
%Previous attempt at a paragraph explanation - is it acceptable to do a numbered list in a scientific paper?
%	We develop an adaptive algorithm to detect the position of the Meiyu front on a given day. For each day from 1951 to 2007 (20819 days total), we first find the quantity and latitude of maximum rainfall for each longitude point. Then, we use the simple criterion of there being a 5 degree continuous chain of maxima over 10 mm/day (20 consecutive cells). We then try to linearly fit these maxima, excluding any maximum that is more than 5 degrees of latitude away from the precipitation centroid given by $<L> =\frac{\sum P_i y_i}{\sum P}$. Next using, this first fit as starting point, we now find the maxima within a $n$-degree latitude window of the best fit line, where we progressively shrink $n$ with each iteration. The choice of $n$ does not greatly impact fit quality. In our experiment, we repeated the fit for $n$= ... . Given a final fit, we report the latitude of the front at 105\textdegree E, the mean intensity of rainfall along the center of its axis and the tilt (in degrees). We also report a quality score $Q$ which indicates the percentage of rainfall that falls within 3 degrees of our best fit line, such that statistical calculations can be repeated only days with a clear front for the purpose of confirmation. 

%new version of paragraph
	\textbf{Paragraph version}

	For each day from January 1 1951 to December 31 2007 (20,819 days at all) we determine whether there is a frontal event, whether there is an additional secondary front, and the characteristics of each. To detect a front, we find the maximum daily rainfall at each longitude inside the window 105-123\textdegree E and 20-40\textdegree N. If a 5\textdegree continuous chain of maxima exceeds 10 mm/day, we seek a fit; otherwise the day is discarded. The fitting algorithm performs a linear least-squares fit of the \textit{latitudes} of each of the maxima, weighted by the intensity of the maximum. Next, we use a recursive fit wherein we find a new set of maxima, requiring that they be within $n$ degrees of the previous best fit line. $n$ is progressively decreased to tighten the window and converge on an optimal fit. Given this fit, we can calculate a quality score $Q$, which is the percentage of total rainfall in our window that falls within 5 degrees of our best fit line. A score of $Q > .6$ constitutes a good score, as further explained below.
	
	In addition, we determine from observation that some days feature two separate bands of strong rainfall. We would like to include such events. Therefore, after fitting a primary event, we check for a secondary event by removing the rainfall associated with the first best fit line, and then repeating all of the steps of the previous paragraph. If a secondary event is detected, we may define two extra quality scores $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, where $Q_1$ is the percentage of rainfall within \textit{after removing rainfall associated with the secondary fit}, and $Q_2$ likewise is the Q score of the secondary fit after removing rainfall from the primary fit.
	
	Finally, in some cases our front criterion will be satisfied, but we are not able to achieve a good fit. We use the quality scores $Q$, $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ to check for this case, as well as one additional metric, the ``Taiwan fraction'' ($TW$), defined as the percentage of daily rainfall that falls on Taiwan. First of all, all days where $TW > 20\%$ are thrown out. Such days are dominated by a local storm reaching Taiwan, and rarely exhibit a coherent front. Subsequently there are two ways a day may be included: 
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item if $Q>.6$, the day is included in our statistics. If $Q_2$ also is greater than .6, the day will be classified as a double front day.
		
		\item If $Q<.6$, a day can only be included if both $Q_1 \mathrm{\textbf{ and }} Q_2 > .6$. In such cases, the quality of fit is initially obscured by the presence of multiple fronts. We classify the day as a double front day.
	\end{enumerate}	
		
	In practice, days with secondary fronts constitute a small fraction of all days ($>$ 5\%) but are more common during certain seasons.
	
\subsection{Statistics}	

	Figure 1a reproduces a plot similar to Ding and Chan's 200x paper, but focusing on eastern China. China receives a substantial fraction of its yearly precipitation outside of summer, unlike a traditional monsoon circulation. Figure 1b shows a H\"ovmoller diagram of the latitudes occupied by the Meiyu Front over all 57 years, including both primary and secondary events, with a 5-day and 2\textdegree smoothing. Frontal events are found throughout the year, with occurrence minimizing in January (10\%) and maximizing in late June (80\%). However, it can be seen that mean rainfall and Meiyu occurrence are not entirely equivalent. For instance, the August peak in southern China rainfall (about 20\textdegree N) does not correspond to a surge in Meiyu events. Other known features of East Asian rainfall are reproduced, such as the spring persistent rains beginning in March.
	
	Four distinct periods of frontal behavior can be isolated from Figure 1: 1) A "Pre-Meiyu" from May 1-June 5 (days 121-155) over southern China (Ding and Chan's first position), when front frequency and intensity increase; 2) Meiyu Season, the period during June 1-July 15 (Ding and Chan stage 2, days 156-200) characterized by a 4 degree shift in mean front latitude within 20 days; 3) A "Post-Meiyu" wherein double front structures are commonly (Ding and Chan stage 3). It can be seen that frontal activity persists both in spring (days 81-120) and in fall (271-300), but with decreased frequency and intensity. . Figure 2 shows that even in winter, rainfall events in China tend to be frontal, but their frequency increases significantly \% during Meiyu Season, and a surge in intensity can be seen around June 1 where mean rainfall along the front exceeds 25 mm/day. The mean tilt of the front is approximately 8 degrees.
	
	As pointed out in \citet{Biasutti2011}, the statistics of rainfall incurrence are dependent on the sampling interval. The intensity of storms likely remains relatively fixed, whereas their frequency increases significantly. This view is confirmed by decades of observation studies such as\citet{Murakami1984}, which find that frontal rainfall consists of a string of mesoscale convective systems (MCS) separated by calm skies.
	
	We focus on several periods of particular behavior:. These correspond to Ding and Chan's ... Table 1 shows the mean characteristics of fronts in each of these periods and their variance.
	
	
	We test for the existence of statistically significant differences between 1951-1979 and 1980-2007 for each of the time periods mentioned above.
	
\section{Preferred jet positions}
Past work has noted the relationship between the subtropical westerly jet and precipitation in east China, and suggested mechanisms for their covariance\citep{Molnar2010, Sampe2010, Chen2014}. We aim to clarify the strength of this relationship, and show that changes in the position of the jet correspond to the rainfall changes in observed in eastern China over recent decades, e.g. the south-flood, north-drought pattern \citep{Nigam2013}. 

\subsection{Methods} 

Our aim is to investigate the relationship between the position of the subtropical westerly jet in eastern China and Meiyu activity. \citep{Schiemann2009} constructed a data set of jet occurrences in the Tibetan Plateau region from the ERA-40 reanalysis.  For a given longitude, a jet `count'  is defined as a local maximum in the horizontal wind field with magnitude greater than $30$ m s$^{-1}$; further details can be found in section 2 of \citep{Schiemann2009}. Since we are interested in the relationship between jet latitude and Meiyu front activity, we only consider the set of this data in the longitude band $90-130^\circ$E, which encompasses the region of Meiyu front activity. We aggregate the jet counts to produce the average daily jet latitude across this across the longitude band for the entire period of the ERA-40 reanalysis, 1958-2001. 

%-> The westerly jet and rainfall are argued to covary on paleoclimate timescales \citep{Nagashima2011}\citep{Nagashima2013}.
	
%	Monthly changes in the position of the jet have previously been reported in \citet{Schiemann2009}, and we do not repeat them here. 

%	It is worth noting that the pre-Meiyu in May corresponds to a time of great jet variability, whereas June features a discernible but meandering jet, and the post-Meiyu corresponds to very low variability in jet position during July and August.

From April to June, the mean jet position migrates northward, from a position anchored to the southern flank of the Tibetan Plateau to a position on the northward flank. During this transition period, the Meiyu front occurs in eastern China. In this section we show that the jet latitude covaries with the latitude of Meiyu events, and that we observe changes in the jet transition behavior corresponding to changes in Meiyu activity demonstrated above.

\label{jet_seasonal}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

(describe figure \ref{jet_seasonal} here) 

\section{Dynamics}

	The covariance of Meiyu front positions and tropospheric jet latitudes previously demonstrated also clarifies a dynamical reason for their seasonality. As shown, Meiyu season consists of intense rainfall from June 1st to July 1st with a shift in latitude of almost 10 degrees over the course of that month. After  In the climatological mean, \cite{Chen2014} demonstrated that the Meiyu front exists primarily due to forced mechanical convergence by the Tibetan Plateau upstream. The season of peak rainfall and peak Meiyu frequency corresponds directly to the period when the westerly jet is impinging on the Tibetan Plateau upstream. When the jet moves further north to its preferred summer position, which occurs just north of the Tibetan Plateau, it is no longer deflected and the front is significantly weaker, and we transition to a preferred double-front state as seen in figure 1b. 

\section{Discussion/Conclusion}

The relation of regional climate change under a \nth{21} century warming regime to global mean change is unclear. In the 5th edition of the IPCC report, the CMIP 5 model suite does not come to a consensus on the sign of future summer rainfall changes in East Asia\citep{Christensen2011}. Energetic constraints on precipitation allow for the separate consideration of global mean response and local circulation feedback \citep{Muller2011}. Several authors have proposed templates for regional mechanisms of change such as the ``rich get richer'' and ``upped ante'' criteria \citep{Held2006,Lintner2007,Chou2009}, but these are not obviously applicable to the East Asian monsoon. Since the behavior of the jet is coupled to global climate variability, our work holds the promise of attributing the regional rainfall trend in China to global-scale change.

The observed southward shift of the tropospheric jet over East Asia during the post-Meiyu season, and generally over the full year, runs counter to the observation in the global mean that the jet has shifted poleward with global warming \CITATIONS. However, recent work suggests that global warming may draw the jet southward over the Pacific Ocean by preferential heating of the eastern Pacific warm pool \citep{Park2014}.

%  SECTION HEADS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Capitalize the first letter of each word (except for
% prepositions, conjunctions, and articles that are
% three or fewer letters).

% AGU follows standard outline style; therefore, there cannot be a section 1 without
% a section 2, or a section 2.3.1 without a section 2.3.2.
% Please make sure your section numbers are balanced.
% ---------------
% Level 1 head
%
% Use the \section{} command to identify level 1 heads;
% type the appropriate head wording between the curly
% brackets, as shown below.
%
%An example:
%\section{Level 1 Head: Introduction}
%
% ---------------
% Level 2 head
%
% Use the \subsection{} command to identify level 2 heads.
%An example:
%\subsection{Level 2 Head}
%
% ---------------
% Level 3 head
%
% Use the \subsubsection{} command to identify level 3 heads
%An example:
%\subsubsection{Level 3 Head}
%
%---------------
% Level 4 head
%
% Use the \subsubsubsection{} command to identify level 3 heads
% An example:
%\subsubsubsection{Level 4 Head} An example.
