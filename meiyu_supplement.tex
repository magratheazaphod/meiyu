\noindent\textbf{Introduction}
In this appendix, we provide more information about the workings of the novel recursive image processing algorithm used to compile statistics of frontal in China for 57 years based on the APHRODITE rain gauge data set \citep{Yatagai2012}. Furthermore, we include the results of the algorithm for different periods of interest, and relay the changes in frontal properties between the periods 1951-1979 and 1980-2007, which is the focus of the manuscript. We have also included a table of changes between the periods 1979-1993 and 1994-2007, which have been described in previous work and are different in nature from those described in Table S1. We also provide more information on the bootstrapping algorithms used to calculate statistical significance, as well as the kernel method used to estimate a density map of jet observations from discrete observations.

\noindent\textbf{Meiyu database}
We have made the full database of Meiyu statistics from January 1 1951 to December 31 2007 available at the author's personal website: \url{http://www.atmos.berkeley.edu/~jessed/mydata.html}

%Repeat for any additional Supporting data sets

\noindent\textbf{Jet database}
The kernel density contours shown in the main text (Figure 4) are derived from the jet counts of \citet{Schiemann2009} in the following way. First, we aggregate all the jet counts in the chosen time period (e.g. for 4b, we aggregate counts from days 121-160 for 1958-1979 and 1980-2001 separately). This results in a gridded histogram of the total number of jet counts, spanning 16.75-58.25 N and 42.5-130 E with 0.25x0.25 degree resolution. To estimate the kernel density, we use the function 'bke2d' from the R package `KernSmooth,' which produces a binned kernel density estimate using the standard bivariate normal distribution. This gives an estimate of the probability density function of jet location in a given time period. 

\clearpage

\noindent\textbf{Front Algorithm}
The following text contains a full description of the recursively convergent algorithm used to find fronts in daily rainfall over China. The overall strategy is to find a single line corresponding to the strongest rainband on a given day (a ``primary'' front), and then to search for a potential additional rainband (a ``secondary front'') by removing all rainfall associated with the primary feature. In addition, we provide figures showing different cases of algorithm functionality.

\noindent\textbf{Recursive Fit}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item For a given day of accumulated rainfall over the longitudes 105-123$^{\circ}$E and 20-40$^{\circ}$N at $.25^{\circ}$ by $.25^{\circ}$ resolution, the first criterion is to check for a band of coherent rainfall maxima. The maximum daily rainfall at each longitude is found. If there exists a $5^{\circ}$ continuous chain of maxima (20 points in a row) exceeding 10 mm day$^{-1}$, we proceed to step 2 and attempt a fit (Figure S1a). Otherwise, no fit is attempted for that day (Figure S1b).
	
	\item A weighted least-squares linear fit of the \textit{latitudes} of the maxima is attempted in MATLAB using the intensity of the maxima as weight, with the goal of finding a linear front. To encourage convergence, the weight of outlying points is set to zero, where an outlier is defined as any maximum that is over $5^{\circ}$ from the \textit{centroid} of the precipitation maxima, calculated by $\left<lat_{max}\right>=\frac{\sum_{long} lat_{max}*max}{\sum_{long} \max}$ (Figure 1c). 
	
	\item A recursive algorithm converges on a best estimate. In each iteration, we find a new set of maxima within \textit{k} degrees of the previous best fit line, and again perform a weighted linear fit of the maxima. $k$ is progressively decreased with each iteration from $5^{\circ}$ to $2^{\circ}$ by $.25^{\circ}$ increments, and then from $2^{\circ}$ to $.25^{\circ}$ by $.25^{\circ}$ increments but repeating each width $k$ twice in a row. The fit obtained in the final iteration is taken as our best estimate of front position.
	
	\item We define the ``quality score'' $Q$ as the fraction of total daily precipitation inside of 105-123$^{\circ}$E and 20-40$^{\circ}$N that falls within $2.5^{\circ}$ degrees of the best estimate line. We also define intensity as mean rainfall at all points along the front axis where daily rainfall exceeds 5 mm day$^{-1}$ (``front points''), length as the total number of front points, and width as the mean distance between half-maxima (in degrees of latitude) on either side of each front point.
	
	\item Given an estimate of primary front position, we check for a secondary front. We start by removing all precipitation associated with the primary frontal event from our daily rainfall map. To do this, all rainfall within 4$^{\circ}$ of our primary front is set to 0, as are all other adjacent points where rainfall exceeds 10 mm day$^{-1}$ (Figure S1?). We then reapply the continuous maximum criterion from step 1. If passed, steps 2-4 are repeated to find a best estimate for the position of the secondary front, and secondary front attributes are calculated.
	
	\item If a secondary front is found, two additional quality scores $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are calculated. $Q_1$ is defined as the fraction of rainfall contained in the primary front \textit{after removing all rainfall associated with the secondary front}. Likewise $Q_2$ is the Q score of the second front \textit{after removing all rainfall from the primary front}.		
	
\end{enumerate} 

In rare cases with two fronts of roughly equal strength but distant in latitude, the removal of outliers in step 2 prevents a fit entirely. We test for such cases by ensuring that the total sum of weights ${\sum_{long} max}$ exceeds 200 mm day$^{-1}$ (equivalent to our condition in bullet point 1). When this condition is failed, we return to step 1, but find maxima only over the latitude range 20N-$\left<lat_{max}\right>$ or $\left<lat_{max}\right>$-40N, depending on which half of our domain has a longer chain of maxima exceeding 10 mm day$^{-1}$, and subsequently proceed as usual.

\noindent\textbf{Quality Control}

After running the algorithm for all 20,819 days from 1 January 1951 to 31 December 2007, we obtained 11,228 frontal fits and 1,116 days with two fronts. Subsequently, we apply a quality control algorithm to eliminate days with poor fits. We define the quality scores $Q$, $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, and the ``Taiwan fraction'' (TW), defined as the percentage of daily rainfall inside the window 105-$123^{\circ}$E and 20-$40^{\circ}$N that falls on the island of Taiwan. We use these metrics to define the following two criteria for inclusion:

\begin{enumerate}

	\item If $TW > 20\%$, the day is thrown out (238 cases total, 2.1\% of total fits). Such days are dominated by a local storm reaching Taiwan and rarely exhibit a strong front.  
	
	\item Subsequently, a day can be included if it meets either of the following criteria:
	
	\begin{enumerate} 
	
	\item if $Q>.6$, the day is included in our statistics (7,522 days, 67.0\% of total fits). If $Q_2$ also is greater than .6, the day will be classified as a double front day (Type I double front; 232 cases, or 3.1\% of days where $Q>.6$).
		
	\item If $Q<.6$, a day can only be included if both $Q_1 \mathrm{\textbf{ and }} Q_2 > .6$ (where again Q1 and Q2 are \textit{conditional} quality scores as defined above). In such cases, the presence of multiple fronts of similar intensity initially obscures the quality of the fit. Such days are also classified as double front days (Type II double front; 466 cases). These statistics are also collectively repeated in supplementary tables S1-S3.
	
	\end{enumerate}
	
\end{enumerate}	
	
	The use of condition 2b adds 466 double front days that would otherwise have been categorized as days with no front, constituting 6.2\% of total days included in our statistics. 33.2\% of double front days are Type I and 66.8\% Type II. Double rainbands occur on 9.3\% of all days (698 out of 7,522 days), but are more common during certain seasons such as the Post-Meiyu (see Figure 1c in main text).

If so, a fit of a frontal event is attempted. a) 25 May 2007 - the continuous maximum criterion is met and a fit is attempted. b) 11 June 2007 - although there is abundant rainfall in some locations, it appears not to be frontal and the continuous maximum criterion is failed. No fit is attempted.}

%S2 - How the convergent fit algorithm works.
\begin{figure}
\noindent\includegraphics[width=36pc]{Figures/S2}
\caption{Display of the functionality of the recursive convergent algorithm. On 29 April 2007, a strong maximum in southernmost China skews our initial frontal fit (panel a), but the algorithm eventually converges on the most prominent coherent band via tighter windowing (panel d).}
\end{figure}

%S3 - Procedure for finding double front cases.
\begin{figure}
\noindent\includegraphics[width=36pc]{Figures/S3}
\caption{a) The algorithm converges on the strongest front, around 37N (defined as the ``primary front''). b) The rainfall associated with the primary front is removed, and we check for the presence of another front (a ``secondary front''), again using the continuous maximum criterion.}
\end{figure}

%S4 - Quality Control algorithm used to determine inclusion in statistics
\begin{figure}
\noindent\includegraphics[width=36pc]{Figures/S4}
\caption{A Quality Control algorithm is used to weed out poor fits. a) 18 August 2007 - Days with a high Taiwan fraction (here, corresponding to the passage of Typhoon Sepat) are excluded from our statistics. b) June 4 2007 - A high-quality fit is achieved. c) 17 April 2007 - Although a fit is reached, it explains the distribution of daily rainfall poorly and is therefore excluded from frontal statistics. d) 21 May 2007 (same as Figure S3) - An initial fit appears to be of poor quality (Q1<.6). However, after finding a secondary front, we determine that conditional quality scores Q1 and Q2 are high, and the day is included in our statistics.}
