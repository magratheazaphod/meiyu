%  SUPPORTING INFORMATION TEMPLATE
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%
%
%
%Please use this template when formatting and submitting your Supporting Information.

%This template serves as both a “table of contents” for the supporting information for your article and as a summary of files.
%
%
%OVERVIEW
%
%Please note that all supporting information will be peer reviewed with your manuscript.
%In general, the purpose of the supporting information is to enable authors to provide and archive auxiliary information such as data %tables, method information, figures, video, or computer software, in digital formats so that other scientists can use it.
%The key criteria are that the data:
% 1. supplement the main scientific conclusions of the paper but are not essential to the conclusions (with the exception of
%    including %data so the experiment can be reproducible);
% 2. are likely to be usable or used by other scientists working in the field;
% 3. are described with sufficient precision that other scientists can understand them, and
% 4. are not exe files.
%
%USING THIS TEMPLATE
%
%All Supporting text and figures should be included in this document. Insert supporting information content into each appropriate section of the template. %Figures and tables should appear above each caption.  To add additional captions, simply copy and paste each sample caption as needed.

%Tables may be included, but can also be uploaded separately, especially if they are larger than 1 page, or if necessary for retaining table formatting. Data sets, large tables, movie files, and audio files should be uploaded separately, following AGU naming conventions. Include their captions in this document and list the file name with the caption. You will be prompted to upload these files on the Upload Files tab during the submission process, using file type “Supporting Information (SI)”

%IMPORTANT NOTE ON FIGURES AND TABLES
% Placeholders for figures and tables appear after the \end{article} command, after references.
% DO NOT USE \psfrag or \subfigure commands.

\noindent\textbf{Introduction}
In this appendix, we provide more information about the workings of the novel recursive image processing algorithm used to compile statistics on the properties of rainfall in China for 57 years. Furthermore, we include the results of the algorithm for different periods of interest, and relay the changes in frontal properties between the periods 1951-1979 and 1980-2007, which is the focus of the manuscript. We have also included a table of changes between the periods 1979-1993 and 1994-2007, which have been described in previous work and are different in nature from those described in Table S1.
%Type or paste your text here. The introduction gives a brief overview of the supporting information. You should include information %about as many of the following as possible (when appropriate):
% 1. a general overview of the kind of data files;
% 2. information about when and how the data were collected or created;
% 3. a general description of processing steps used;
% 4. any known imperfections or anomalies in the data.

\noindent\textbf{Front Algorithm}
The following text contains a full description of the recursively convergent algorithm used to find fronts in daily rainfall over China. The main text contains the end products of the algorithm and the reported products, but the full workings of the algorithm are described below.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item For a given day of accumulated rainfall over the longitudes 105E-123E and 20N-40N at .25\textdegree\ by .25\textdegree\ resolution, the first criterion is to check for a band of coherent rainfall maxima. The maximum daily rainfall at each longitude is found. If there exists a 5\textdegree continuous chain of maxima (20 points in a row) exceeding 10 mm/day, we proceed to step 2 and attempt a fit. Otherwise, there is no front on that day.
	
	\item A weighted least-squares linear fit of the \textit{latitudes} of the maxima is attempted, using the intensity of the maxima as weight: 
	
	equation...
	
	This equation is solved in MATLAB using the backslash operator.
	
	\item A recursive algorithm converges on a best estimate. In each iteration, we find a new set of maxima within \textit{k} degrees of the previous best fit line, and again repeat the weighted linear fit in step 2. $k$ is progressively decreased with each iteration.
	
	\item Using our final best estimate from step 3, we define the ``quality score'' $Q$ as the fraction of total daily precipitation that falls within 5 degrees of this fit line.
	
	\item As mentioned, we check for a secondary front. We remove all precipitation within the primary front and again apply the front criterion in step 1 to the leftover rainfall map. If passed, steps 2-4 are repeated to find a best estimate for a secondary front.
	
	\item If a secondary front is found, two additional quality scores $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are determined. $Q_1$ is defined as the fraction of rainfall contained in the primary front \textit{after removing all rainfall associated with the secondary front}. Likewise $Q_2$ is the Q score of the second front \textit{after removing all rainfall from the primary front}.		
	
\end{enumerate} 

In some cases, a fit will be achieved, but its quality will be too poor to include in our statistics. To check for this scenario, we use the quality scores $Q$, $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, and the ``Taiwan fraction'' (TW), defined as the percentage of daily rainfall that falls on the island of Taiwan. If $TW > 20\%$, the day is thrown out. Such days are dominated by a local storm reaching Taiwan and rarely exhibit a strong front. Subsequently there are two ways a day may be included: 
	
\begin{enumerate}
	\item if $Q>.6$, the day is included in our statistics. If $Q_2$ also is greater than .6, the day will be classified as a double front day.		
		
	\item If $Q<.6$, a day can only be included if both $Q_1 \mathrm{\textbf{ and }} Q_2 > .6$. In such cases, the quality of fit is initially obscured by the presence of multiple fronts. We classify the day as a double front day.
\end{enumerate}	
		
	In practice, days with secondary fronts constitute a small fraction of all days ($>$ 5\%) but are more common during certain seasons (see Figure \ref{dingchan}c).

 \[ x^2=y^2 + z^2\]

 Math coded inside \begin{equation} and \end{equation} will
 be automatically numbered, e.g.,:
 \begin{equation}
 x^2=y^2 + z^2
 \end{equation}

% IF YOU HAVE MULTI-LINE EQUATIONS, PLEASE
% BREAK THE EQUATIONS INTO TWO OR MORE LINES
% OF SINGLE COLUMN WIDTH (20 pc, 8.3 cm)
% using double backslashes (\\).

% To create multiline equations, use the
% \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% as demonstrated below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
  y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
\end{eqnarray}

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
%\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with
% the first character following the equal sign on the
% first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space
% into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate
% unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g.
% \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve
% the correct amount of space.

%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.

% For tables and figures, add \usepackage{rotating} to the paper and add the rotating.sty file to the folder.
% AGU prefers the use of {sidewaystable} over {landscapetable} as it causes fewer problems.
